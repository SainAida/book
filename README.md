<h1>Plot</h1>
The novel tells the story of two middle—aged friends - the successful composer Clive Linley and the editor-in-chief of a London newspaper Vernon Holiday. After the death of Molly Lane, the ladies of both men's hearts in the past, the friends conclude an agreement according to which they undertake to euthanize each other if they suffer from the same serious illness that Molly had.

Molly's widower, George, sells Vernon photographs compromising the British Foreign Secretary — their common enemy and Molly's lover Julian Harmony, taken by Molly and depicting Harmony as a transvestite. Clive, who is working on the most important order of his career — the so—called "Millennium Symphony" - does not approve of Vernon's desire to publish this material to save the falling rating of his newspaper, which leads to a quarrel between friends. In search of a muse, Clive goes to the Lake District, where he accidentally observes the beginning of a possible rape, but, being immersed in work, does not help the woman. Back in London, Clive shares his impressions with Vernon. He accuses Clive of cowardice, and they quarrel again.
